# Multi-Agent Systems Coursework

The goal of this project was to create a multi-agent system which deals with the smartphone supply chain problem. The system will take customer orders, 
purchase components in order to fulfil these orders, assemble the phones and then ship the finished products to the customers. The aim of this is to represent
a Supply Chain and replicate the day to day activities of a company looking to maximise profits with daily changing variables.
